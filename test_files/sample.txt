This is a sample document for testing Dynamic RAG functionality.

Dynamic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a new approach that doesn't require pre-built vector databases. Instead, it retrieves and processes relevant files at query time.

Key features of Dynamic RAG:
1. Real-time file retrieval
2. No need for pre-indexing
3. Immediate reflection of file changes
4. Reduced storage requirements

This technology is particularly useful for scenarios where:
- Files change frequently
- Storage space is limited
- Quick deployment is needed
- The file library is small to medium-sized

Dynamic RAG works by:
1. Intelligently selecting relevant files based on the query
2. Processing file content in real-time
3. Vectorizing both query and documents on-the-fly
4. Computing similarity scores
5. Generating answers based on the most relevant content

This approach offers flexibility and efficiency for document-based question answering systems.
